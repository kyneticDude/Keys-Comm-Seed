Established in July 2009, by a black lady with mission to OCCUPY ALL STREETS (yes we are 100% Black Owned, and 100%& Black Managed!) So kahle kahle, we are Township Outdoor Media Owners who seek to grant Big Brands/Products and Services access, positioning and noting in South African Townships. This is done through High Definition Production Finishes on Township Wall Media, a tool that allows us to offer uncompromised quality and great value. </p>

                    <p>We are closely connected to our Townships and Communities, in that while we do our work, we continue to uplift communities through our CSI Model that seeks to use existing Township Walls for advertising purposes, which always results in income for the use of the wall that has been advertised on, so in a nutshell, we empower Brands to Empower Communities, the more you spend with us, the more communities grow, it is a perfect Township Entrepreneurship Model, combined with Philanthropy.</p>
